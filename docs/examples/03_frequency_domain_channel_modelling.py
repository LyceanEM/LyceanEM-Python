Modelling a Physical Channel in the Frequency Domain
======================================================

This example uses the frequency domain :func: `lyceanem.models.frequency_domain.calculate_scattering` function to predict the scattering parameters for the frequency and environment included in the model.
This model allows for a very wide range of antennas and antenna arrays to be considered, but for simplicity only horn antennas will be included in this example. The simplest case would be a single source point and single receive point, rather than an aperture antenna such as a horn.
