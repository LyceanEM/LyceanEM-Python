  abstract  = {The use of millimetre waves (mmWave) requires the development of novel, robust over the air (OTA) test methods. One low-cost OTA method is based upon an elliptical arrangement of reflectors, to allow conformance testing of devices at mmWave. A discrete ray model is used to predict the influence of reflector shape and arrangement on scattering at 24GHz for two reference surfaces of differing size and a substrate reflector. The model shows a correlation of 0.99 between the predicted and measured scattering for the larger reference surface, and root mean square (RMS) error of -69dB, while for the smaller reference surface the model achieved a correlation of 0.98 between the predicted and measured scattering, and an RMS error of -69dB.},

Allowing a project team to evaluate the influence of platform structure, antenna or array geometry and beamforming architecture on overall system performance. Using spatial measurements of a Sea Searcher X band radar as an example, LyceanEM is used to predict the influence of reflector shape on maximum achievable directivity, and predicted antenna pattern, compared with full electromagnetic solver (CST) at 9.3GHz. LyceanEM showed a correlation of 0.8 between the predicted and full solver antenna pattern, predicting a maximum directivity of 19.36dBi, compared to 21.97dBi for CST, using 109 seconds of runtime, versus 37 hours for the time domain solver.},

    abstract = { This paper evaluates the performance of three-dimensionally (3D) printed spiral phase plates (SPPs) for enabling an orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexed radio system. The design and realization of the SPPs by means of additive manufacturing exploiting a high-permittivity material is described. Modes 1 and 2 SPPs are then evaluated at 15 GHz in terms of 3D complex radiation pattern, mode purity and beam collimation by means of a 3D printed dielectric lens. The results with the lens yield a crosstalk of −8 dB for between modes 1 and −1, and −11.4 dB for between modes 2 and −2. We suggest a mode multiplexer architecture that is expected to further reduce the crosstalk for each mode. An additional loss of 4.2 dB is incurred with the SPPs inserted into the communication link, which is undesirable for obtaining reliable LTE-based communications. Thus, we suggest: using lower loss materials, seeking ways to reduce material interface reflections or alternative ways of OAM multiplexing to realize a viable OAM multiplexed radio system. }

@conference{Pelham2024, title = "LyceanEM: GigaScale Electromagnetics for Beamforming and System Planning", abstract = "Space-based solar power (SBSP) generation is proposed as an attractive zero emission solution to provide scalable, dependable energy. Space-based solar satellites outfitted with photovoltaic cells can use microwave antenna arrays to transfer the generated power to ground based receiving stations. However, the scale of energy transfer involved requires a careful assessment of the composition of the power transfer beam, and the effects of the selected beamforming architecture on generated power at the receiving station. This in addition to the potential for interference, and concerns about the required microwave power densities on the local environment and population.In order to support the developmment of Space-based solar power, the modelling architecture required to predict these factors is a key enabling technology, not only for the design and validation, but also to establish the safety case for operation.LyceanEM is being developed in order to address these requirements, offering a scalable computational model which supports gigascale antenna array design and modelling under the SCOPES project.In order to provide reliable power transfer beams, a number of different beamforming schemes have been proposed for space based solar power, from retro-directive beamforming, to synthesized Flat Top beam patterns. In the ideal case, the power transfer beam would illuminate the receiving rectenna array with a uniform power density across the entire surface of the array, rapidly dropping to zero outside the array boundary. The progress towards support for antenna arrays with over 10 billion elements will be presented, together with the power transfer efficiency and interference implications of proposed beamforming schemes.", author = "Timothy Pelham and Kudera, {Sebastian M} and Fearon, {Thomas C}", year = "2024", month = apr, day = "19", language = "English", note = "International Conference on Energy from Space ; Conference date: 17-04-2024 Through 19-04-2024", url = "https://indico.esa.int/event/498/overview", }

   abstract = {Space-based solar power has been proposed as early as the 1960s as a source of reliable and clean energy. Due to reductions in the cost of orbital access it has received renewed interest in recent years. A practical challenge to the deployment of these systems is the requirement for ultra-large scale antenna arrays for wireless power transfer at scale, with proposed GW scale systems with antenna array diameters on the order of 2km, with billions of antenna elements. In this paper a development of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld Diffraction Integral is introduced together with CUDA accelerated ray tracing for flexible modelling. A simplified parallel antenna array model is introduced at 10GHz demonstrating the effectiveness of different beamforming algorithms, together with preliminary results of a larger array scenario for wireless power transfer over 5.9km to a receiving array in a 5km square map tile.},

The impact of focal distance, illuminator offset from focal spot, and platform scattering are examined for an antenna to be mounted to an 8U CubeSat chassis with a constant arc length for the parabolic reflector.

@article{Hannan1964,
   abstract = {In a phased-array antenna with a very large number of regularly-spaced radiating elements, the gain realized at the beam peak is equal to the number of elements times the gain realized in the same direction when only one typical element is excited. The ideal radiation pattern of one such element in a large planar array has a cosine variation of gain with angle when the elements are closely spaced, and has a peak value of gain equal to 4?rA/X2 where A is the area allotted to each element The active impedance of each element in a practical phased array varies with scan angle, becauseof mutual coupling between the elements. The associated mismatch causes power to be returned to the generators, thereby reducing the gain realized by the array and by the element. The element pattern, measured in the proper environment of surrounding elements, deviates from the ideal pattern in proportion to this effect. Mutual coupling is inherently unavoidable in a closely-spaced infinite array of elements; for example, in a square array with less than X / ⊡2 spacing. There is a loss of element efficiency caused by the coupling, and since coupling increases with closer spacing, this accounts for the lower gain expected from ideal elements with reduced allotted area. Grating lobes can exist when the elements are not closely spaced; for example, in a square array with more than X/2 spacing. In this case, the ideal pattern is truncated to discriminate against grating lobes; this gives the higher gain expected from ideal elements with larger allotted area It isc oncluded that in ap hased-array antenna having a very large number of regularly-spaced radiating elements, perfect impedance match for all scan angles can be postulated for every typical element without encountering any real discrepancy in the determination of element gain. In the absence of grating lobes, such an antennaw ould realize the greatest possible gain for all scan angles. © 1964, IEEE. All Rights Reserved.},
