LyceanEM is the development of initial PhD research into conformal antenna array design :footcite:p:`Pelham2021a`.

The intention is the LyceanEM can be used both in a systems design context to allow the user to evaluate different antenna array on platform configurations for performance against system requirements, while also allowing more fundamental electromangetics scattering research.



If LyceanEM has been useful to your research and you would like to acknowledge the projection in your publication,
we would like to encourage you to cite the following paper :footcite:p:`Pelham2021a`.
