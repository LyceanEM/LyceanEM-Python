**LyceanEM** is a Python library for modelling electromagnetic propagation for sensors and communications.
:ref:`Frequency Domain <frequency_domain>` and :ref:`Time Domain <time_domain>` models are included that allow the
user to model a wide array of complex problems from antenna array architecture and assess beamforming algorithm
performance to channel modelling. The model is built upon a ray tracing approach, allowing for efficient modelling of
large, low density spaces.

.. note::
   This project is under active development, but can be installed via pip or by cloning the git repository, as described in the :ref:`install <installation>` documentation.

Installation
-------------
To install LyceanEM from pip

.. code-block:: console

   $  pip install LyceanEM


Development
-----------
To install LyceanEM for development, clone the repository using git

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone 'https://github.com/LyceanEM/LyceanEM-Python.git'

The module can then be installed using pip by navigating to the git folder.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install -e .

If you are interesting in developing LyceanEM, you should clone from Github and install with the editable flag set.
