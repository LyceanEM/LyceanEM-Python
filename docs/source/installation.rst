Installation
=====

LyceanEM is not currently setup to install via pip, so the recommended method is to clone the repository from github, and then install from the repository

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone 'https://github.com/LyceanEM/LyceanEM-Python.git'

The module can then be installed by navigating into the repository and using pip.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install .LyceanEM
