  abstract  = {The use of millimetre waves (mmWave) requires the development of novel, robust over the air (OTA) test methods. One low-cost OTA method is based upon an elliptical arrangement of reflectors, to allow conformance testing of devices at mmWave. A discrete ray model is used to predict the influence of reflector shape and arrangement on scattering at 24GHz for two reference surfaces of differing size and a substrate reflector. The model shows a correlation of 0.99 between the predicted and measured scattering for the larger reference surface, and root mean square (RMS) error of -69dB, while for the smaller reference surface the model achieved a correlation of 0.98 between the predicted and measured scattering, and an RMS error of -69dB.},

Allowing a project team to evaluate the influence of platform structure, antenna or array geometry and beamforming architecture on overall system performance. Using spatial measurements of a Sea Searcher X band radar as an example, LyceanEM is used to predict the influence of reflector shape on maximum achievable directivity, and predicted antenna pattern, compared with full electromagnetic solver (CST) at 9.3GHz. LyceanEM showed a correlation of 0.8 between the predicted and full solver antenna pattern, predicting a maximum directivity of 19.36dBi, compared to 21.97dBi for CST, using 109 seconds of runtime, versus 37 hours for the time domain solver.},

    abstract = { This paper evaluates the performance of three-dimensionally (3D) printed spiral phase plates (SPPs) for enabling an orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexed radio system. The design and realization of the SPPs by means of additive manufacturing exploiting a high-permittivity material is described. Modes 1 and 2 SPPs are then evaluated at 15 GHz in terms of 3D complex radiation pattern, mode purity and beam collimation by means of a 3D printed dielectric lens. The results with the lens yield a crosstalk of −8 dB for between modes 1 and −1, and −11.4 dB for between modes 2 and −2. We suggest a mode multiplexer architecture that is expected to further reduce the crosstalk for each mode. An additional loss of 4.2 dB is incurred with the SPPs inserted into the communication link, which is undesirable for obtaining reliable LTE-based communications. Thus, we suggest: using lower loss materials, seeking ways to reduce material interface reflections or alternative ways of OAM multiplexing to realize a viable OAM multiplexed radio system. }
