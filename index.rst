Welcome to LyceanEM's documentation!
====================================
**LyceanEM** is a Python library for modelling electromagnetic propagation for sensors and communications. :ref:`Frequency Domain <frequency_domain>` and :ref:`Time Domain <time_domain>` models are included that allow the user to model a wide array of complex problems from antenna array architecture and assess beamforming algorithm performance to channel modelling. The model is built upon a ray tracing approach, and currently has been used for published research by the author at 24GHz.

.. note::
   This project is under active development, but can be installed by cloning the git repository, as described in the :ref:`install <installation>` documentation.
